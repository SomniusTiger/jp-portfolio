        This is an animation I did showing off some future UI I did for a futuristic cycle. This was my first step in to futuristic UI and 3D animation over a year ago. I am currently working on its spirtual son, which I hope to have finished by the end of April.

        Magic Mouse
      .project-section-descript
        This is my magic mouse that I modled and rendered in 3D. It was a fun exercise to play around with lighting in Cinema, creating a professional product shot at the same time.
