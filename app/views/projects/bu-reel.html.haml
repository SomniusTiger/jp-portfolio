        During my time at Brooklyn United I animated and made assets for the 2014 Reel, which contained of all the work they had done up until then.

        The How
      .project-section-descript
        I did all of the animation for this in After Effects. All the assets were made in Illustrator, Photoshop and Cinema 4D. All the clicks and sounds were mixed in Audition, and the music is from my wonderful friend Casey Lalonde.

      .project-section-descript
        One of my favorite things I tried during the reel was a seamless 3D to 2D transition. I wanted the shot to appear like the iPhone had been dropped on the table. I animated an iPhone in Cinema 4D, and then made the iPhone texture overlay the 3D version via After Effects.
